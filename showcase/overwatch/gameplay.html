			<h1>Gameplay</h1>
			<p>In Overwatch, you control one of several heroes in competitive 6-person team shooting matches. Battle over objectives, take down the other team, and achieve victory!</p>

			<div class="gamemodebox">
				<h1>Heroes</h1>

				<p>Before you begin a game of Overwatch, you’ll need to choose a hero to play. Maybe controlling a cannon-toting, genetically-engineered ape from the moon appeals to you. Or, you might prefer zipping around as a teleporting, time-traveling freedom fighter. Who do you want to be?</p>

				<h1>PLAYING OVERWATCH: THE BASICS</h1>
				<p>Before you jump onto the battlefield, we recommend that you play the short tutorial. It’s a quick, fun introduction to the basics of Overwatch.</p>

				<h2>Abilities</h2>
				<p>Abilities are the unique powers and gear Overwatch’s heroes use to defeat their opponents, protect their teammates and move around maps—they’re the key to winning a match.
				You’ll fire your primary weapon (PC: Left-click; PS4: R2; XB1: RT) most commonly. Whether your weapon is short-range, long-range, enemy-freezing or projectile-firing, you don’t need to find ammo for it—just reload (PC: R; PS4: Square; XB1: X) and keep blasting away! Some weapons have secondary fire modes (PC: Right-click; PS4: L2; XB1: LT), variations on their primary weapon’s attack.
				Different heroes also have diverse movement and support abilities, among them hard-light sentry turrets, sonic speed boosts, and short-range teleportation (just to name a few). Some abilities are limited by cooldowns—a short period of time before the ability can be used again.</p>

				<h2>Quick Melee</h2>
				<p>Every hero can perform a melee attack (PC: V; PS4/XB1: Right thumbstick), a quick, close-range strike that doesn’t use any ammo. Use it to finish off weak opponents or when you need to reload.</p>

				<h2>Ultimate Abilities</h2>
				<p>Ultimates (PC: Q; PS4: Triangle; XB1: Y) are game-changers, powerful abilities that can turn the tide of battle. You automatically charge them over time, but you can gain charge faster when you deal damage. As long as you don't switch heroes, your ultimate's charge level will stick around even if you die.</p>
			</div>

			<h1>Gamemodes &amp; Maps</h1>

			<div class="gamemodebox">
				<h1>Assault</h1>

				<p>
				In Assault (aka Capture) maps, two teams battle over control of the map, one team on offense, the other on defense. The attackers' goal is to capture critical objectives, while the defenders must maintain control over them until time runs out.
				</p>

				<div class="mapbox">
					<div class="mapimage mi-anubis"><h1>Anubis</h1></div>
					<div class="mapdescription">
					<p>Nestled among the ancient ruins of the Giza Plateau on the outskirts of Cairo, the Temple of Anubis is one of many new excavations in the area. While most believe that the site is of interest for archaeological reasons, it also hides the entrance to a research facility that extends deep beneath the earth. The facility is alleged to house an artificial intelligence, but the whole truth is known only to a select few. Not even the agents of Helix Security International, who guard the facility, know what they're protecting.</p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="mapbox">
					<div class="mapimage mi-hanamura"><h1>Hanamura</h1></div>
					<div class="mapdescription">
					<p>Hanamura is a well-preserved village of unassuming shops and quiet streets, known mostly for its idyllic cherry blossom festival every spring. But to those who know its history, Hanamura is the ancestral home of the Shimada ninja clan, which had grown over the centuries to become a powerful criminal organization. As its neighboring cities expanded, Hanamura was encircled, and eventually it was incorporated as a district within a larger city. For now, the imposing compound of the Shimada family lies empty, but that peace may soon be broken.</p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="mapbox">
					<div class="mapimage mi-volskaya"><h1>Volskaya</h1></div>
					<div class="mapdescription">
					<p>Volskaya Industries is a Russian company involved in Svyatogor production. Katya Volskaya is its CEO. In more recent times, in light of increased aggression from the Siberian omnium, the company increased production.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="gamemodebox">
				<h1>Control</h1>

				<p>
				On Control maps, two teams fight over a series of objective areas in a best-of-three format. When a team is in control of the round's control point, they will make progress toward capturing it, and whichever team gets to 100% first wins the round. In each map, there are 3 separated sub-area with different kinds of terrain and control point. The match will be played in Best of 5 format for Competitive Play and Best of 3 format for other modes.</p>

				<div class="mapbox">
					<div class="mapimage mi-lijiang"><h1>Lijiang</h1></div>
					<div class="mapdescription">
					<p>Lijiang Tower was built in the heart of a modern Chinese metropolis, its busy streets lined with stores, gardens, restaurants, and famous night markets, where foods from around the region are available at all hours. The tower itself is home to one of the leading companies in China's state-of-the-art space industry, Lucheng Interstellar, an organization with a long pioneering history that is currently pushing the boundaries of space exploration.</p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="mapbox">
					<div class="mapimage mi-nepal"><h1>Nepal</h1></div>
					<div class="mapdescription">
					<p>Years ago, a group of omnic robots experienced what they described as a spiritual awakening. They abandoned their programmed lives to establish a monastery high in the Himalayas, where like-minded omnics could gather to meditate on the nature of their existence. Led by their spiritual leader, Tekhartha Mondatta, they took over the ruins of an ancient monastery and turned it into the home of the Shambali, a place where omnics and humans alike make pilgrimages in the hopes of finding a greater truth.</p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="mapbox">
					<div class="mapimage mi-ilios"><h1>Ilios</h1></div>
					<div class="mapdescription">
					<p>Ilios is located in the Aegean sea of Greece, which is part of the Mediterranean Sea. Situated atop a small island rising from the Aegean Sea, Ilios is a postcard-perfect Mediterranean town, with a bustling harborside, winding paths for rambling hillside strolls, and gorgeous vistas. It is the ideal vacation stop for people looking for a place to relax, or for those interested in exploring the ruins scattered at the top of the island, where many artifacts and relics of the ancient world have been recently unearthed.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="gamemodebox">
				<h1>Escort</h1>

				<p>
				On the Escort (aka Payload) map, the attacking team's objective is to move the payload through 2 checkpoints to a delivery point, while the defenders must halt the attackers' progress until time runs out.</p>

				<div class="mapbox">
					<div class="mapimage mi-dorado"><h1>Dorado</h1></div>
					<div class="mapdescription">
					<p>It is Festival de la Luz in Dorado, an annual celebration of the end of the Omnic Crisis and the period of darkness – both figurative and literal – that engulfed Mexico when the omnics destroyed much of the country’s power grid and infrastructure. But there is a new dawn, as LumériCo and its CEO, war hero and former president Guillermo Portero, are unveiling a string of fusion plants that promise to deliver clean, free energy to the Mexican people.	The attacking team begins in Missión Dorado, a historic location famous for the sound of the ornamental bells that hang amidst its arches.</p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="mapbox">
					<div class="mapimage mi-gibraltar"><h1>Gibraltar</h1></div>
					<div class="mapdescription">
					<p>Watchpoint: Gibraltar stands on the strategic point of the Rock of Gibraltar, and was an Overwatch outpost that stood guard over the Mediterranean. The base was shut down, but the base showed signs of activity in recent times. This was from Winston, who as part of his intent to reform Overwatch, intended to bring the group's communication network back online. Constructing a satellite drone, he needed to get it to a rocket. The drone was successfully launched, and he looked on with pride.</p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="mapbox">
					<div class="mapimage mi-route66"><h1>Route 66</h1></div>
					<div class="mapdescription">
					<p>Though the travelers and road trippers who used to cross the US on historic Route 66 are gone, the Main Street of America still stands, a testament to a simpler time. The gas stations, roadside shops, and cafes have gone into disuse, and the fabled Deadlock Gorge is mostly seen from the comfort of transcontinental train cars. But amid the fading monuments of that earlier era, the outlaws of the Deadlock Gang are planning their biggest heist yet.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="gamemodebox">
				<h1>Hybrid</h1>

				<p>Hybrid maps are combinations between Assault and Escort maps. In them, the attacking team must capture a point, then push a payload through a checkpoint to its delivery point. The defending team must halt their progress until time runs out.</p>

				<div class="mapbox">
					<div class="mapimage mi-eichenwalde"><h1>Eichenwalde</h1></div>
					<div class="mapdescription">
					<p>Eichenwalde is located in the middle of the Black Forest. The town was the site of one of the most famous battles during the Omnic Crisis. It was here that the leader of the Crusaders, Balderich von Adler, and a handful of his best soldiers made a last stand against an advancing automaton army. Outnumbered and outgunned, they were ultimately slain during the resulting combat. However, thanks to their valiant efforts, the German military was able to push back the omnic offensive and win the fight. In the present day, Eichenwalde lies abandoned, and the forest has slowly begun overtaking the village. However, the scars of war will never completely fade.</p>

				<div class="mapbox">
					<div class="mapimage mi-hollywood"><h1>Hollywood</h1></div>
					<div class="mapdescription">
					<p>Welcome to the glitz and glamour of Hollywood, California, where palm trees and fancy cars line the streets, and movie stars, directors, and high-powered studio executives rub shoulders for a chat and drink at Galand's. Down the street from the Mandarin Theatre, Goldshire Studios' omnic film auteur Hal-Fred Glitchbot has created his two latest films, They Came From Beyond The Moon and Six-Gun Killer, to varying amounts of critical and commercial acclaim. However, even Tinseltown has been gripped by anti-omnic sentiment, and the outspoken director has become a prime target in the escalating conflict.</p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="mapbox">
					<div class="mapimage mi-kingsrow"><h1>King's Row</h1></div>
					<div class="mapdescription">
					<p>A ritzy neighborhood, King's Row is situated in the heart of England, and has cobblestone streets. It has its own police force. Omnics here are denied the same rights as humans. Nowhere else in the world are human-omnic tensions as high as in this neighborhood.</p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="mapbox">
					<div class="mapimage mi-numbani"><h1>Numbani</h1></div>
					<div class="mapdescription">
					<p>Numbani is an utopian city on the edge of the African savanna, on the western coast along the belt that runs from Ghana to Nigeria. Numbani Tours offers vacations to the city. Called the City of Harmony, omnic-human equality is at the core of Numbani. Omnics and humans built Numbani together, and their mutual cooperation is the driving force behind Numbani's success. It celebrates an event called "Unity Day". At some point after the Omnic Crisis, it was identified as an area with an active threat. It is currently under threat by Doomfist.</p>
