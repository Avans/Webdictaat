				<h1>Welcome to the Kerbal Space Program Information Center</h1>
				<p><strong>This site is created by 2 students from Avans Hogeschool in Den Bosch. This site contain information about a game called “Kerbal Space Program.”</strong></p>
				
				<h2>Introducing Kerbal Space Program!</h2>
				<p>KSP is a game where the players create and manage their own space program. Build spacecraft, fly them, and try to help the Kerbals to fulfill their ultimate mission of conquering space.
				The game is currently under heavy development. This means the game will be improved on a regular basis, so be sure to check back for new updates. Right now, KSP is in Sandbox Complete state, but we want you to try it out and have fun with it. The Demo version is free to download and play, and will remain so forever.
				The KSP Team is strongly commited to the project, and we are always listening for feedback from the players. </p>

				<h2>Launch spacecrafts</h2>

				<p>In Kerbal Space program, you launch spacecrafts (which you build yourself) into space. You have to control the spacecraft, make orbits around planets, land on planets, gather unknown substances on other planets, and a lot more!</p>

				<p>Building your own spacecraft isn't easy; you have to make sure it:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Is balanced properly</li>
					<li>Is not too heavy</li>
					<li>Has enough fuel to actually reach its destination</li>
					<li>Has enough power to compensate for the weight of the extra fuel and/or other additions like a science lab</li>
				</ul>

				<p>Once you're done building your spacecraft you have to launch it into space. Controlling a spacecraft is easy enough once you get the hang of it, but at the beginning it can be quite a hard task to get your rocket to make an orbit around Kerbin!

				</div>

				<h2>Explore planets</h2>

				<p>In Kerbal Space Program, your primary goal is exploring the universe. Obviously this includes exploring planets: you will spend most of your time flying spacecrafts from planet to planet, using their orbit to meet the next one.</p>

				<p>Controlling a spacecraft is fairly complicated; especially landing on a planet with low gravity or lifting off from a planet with high gravity are hard tasks that require some practice. And, of course, you have to make sure you have enough fuel to actually lift off and land again!</p>

				<h2>Complete missions to earn funds</h2>

				<p>In career mode you have to gain funds to build spacecrafts by completing missions. Most missions are one of the following:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Test part X on the ground/in the air at a certain altitude/in space</li>
					<li>Reach a certain altitude</li>
					<li>Make an orbit around planet X</li>
					<li>Land on planet X</li>
					<li>Collect scientific materials from planet X</li>
				</ul>
				<p>The goal of the missions is mainly to make you think carefully about the way you build your spacecrafts before you actually send them into space. After all, components cost money, and money can only be earned by completing missions!</p>

					<br>
				</div>

				<h2>Gather science and unlock new parts</h2>

				<p>In Kerbal Space Program you also gather science from things such as:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Making crew reports when landed/in air/in space</li>
					<li>Taking ground samples</li>
					<li>Collecting scientific data</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Science can be used to unlock new parts which, in turn, allows you to build more advanced (and bigger!) spacecrafts to explore even further. The more science you collect on a trip, the faster you will advance in the tree.</p>
