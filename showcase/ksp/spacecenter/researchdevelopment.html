					<hr>
					<p>
					The Research and Development Facility was added in version 0.22 and is only accessible in Career mode and Science mode. In Sandbox mode the facility is closed.
					</p>

					<a class="textAnchor" id="functions"></a>
					<h3>Functions</h3>
					<hr>
					<p>
						The R&amp;D facility serves two functions: unlocking parts in nodes of the Technology tree, and reviewing the results of science activities. It also has some cool bridges to pilot under.<br />
						The Technology tab displays the tech tree. On it are the unlocked nodes and all nodes directly following them. Unlocking nodes requires Science points, though parts in locked nodes whose prerequisite nodes have been unlocked can be individually unlocked with funds.<br />
						The Science Archives allows browsing results of previously executed science activities. There are several filters available to limit it only to a specific body, situation, biome or experiment. Seeing which areas the experimental data is lacking from helps guide where best to send science-focused missions.<br />
					</p>

					<a class="textAnchor" id="agency"></a>
					<h3>Agency</h3>
					<hr>
					<p>
						Since version 0.24, Research &amp; Development Department has been an agency offering contracts, one of only two[outdated] which is not a manufacturer. Their contracts are focused entirely on gathering Science data and doing things that have never been done before. Crew survival isn't unwelcome either.
					</p>

					
					<h3>Agency description</h3>
					<p>
						The Space Program's own Research &amp; Development Department. Headed by celebrity rocket scientist Wernher von Kerman, these guys are the brains of the whole operation. Driven by an unquenchable thirst for knowledge, no piece of data is too small or too irrelevant, and increasing the accumulated knowledge of Kerbalkind is their main motivation. Our resident geniuses only ask to be given due academic credit for their contributions to science, and that all astronauts PLEASE refrain from entering the labs without cleaning their boots first
					</p>


					<a class="textAnchor" id="bugs"></a>
					<h3>Bugs</h3>
					<hr>
					<p>
						In the first official release in 0.23.5, the scientific progress was reset when visiting the facility using a save from an old version. An update afterwards changing the version number to 0.23.5.464 fixed that issue.
