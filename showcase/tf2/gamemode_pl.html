			<h1>Payload</h1>
			<hr>
			<p>
				On Payload maps, the BLU team must escort a cart full of explosives through a series of checkpoints and into the RED team's 
				base within a certain amount of time. BLU team members move or "push" the cart by standing next to it - the more people near 
				the cart, the faster it moves. Any RED team member standing near the cart will stop it from venturing further. If a BLU player 
				does not push the cart after 30 seconds have passed, the cart will start slowly moving backwards until it reaches a 
				checkpoint/BLU spawn or a BLU player stands next to it again. The cart works as a Level 1 Dispenser for the BLU team (and 
				disguised enemy Spies) to restore health and ammunition to those pushing it.
			</p>
			
			<h2>Gameplay</h2>
			<hr>
			<p>
				Payload maps may or may not be split into multiple rounds. Some maps traditionally have one-way routes from the BLU team's side, 
				sometimes closed off until a specific point is taken. Maps such as Gold Rush, Hoodoo, and Thunder Mountain are split into three 
				stages that the BLU team must advance through and win. Stages one and two have two checkpoints and stage three has three checkpoints
				(two for Hoodoo), counting the final point as such. The Badwater Basin and Upward maps have a single round with four checkpoints, 
				counting the final point as such. Advancing the cart to the next checkpoint gives the BLU team extra time. Advancing it to the 
				final point moves the map onto the next stage. When the cart reaches the final point on the final stage, the Payload cart will 
				explode killing anyone standing too close to it and destroying the RED team's base as well, thus symbolizing the BLU team's victory.

			<h2>Payload Race</h2>
			<hr>
			<p>
				Unlike Standard Payload maps, Payload Race maps feature both the RED and BLU teams issued with a cart, therefore teams are not 
				defined to an attacking or defending role. To win, each team must simultaneously push their cart through enemy territory to reach
				the finishing point while preventing the enemy team from doing the same. As with Payload maps, team members push the cart by standing
				next to it, with more members increasing the speed of the cart and any opposing team member standing near the cart stopping it. Also
				like Payload, each cart works as a Level 1 Dispenser for their team (and disguised enemy Spies), restoring health and ammunition 
				to those pushing the cart.
			</p>
			<p>
				Unlike Payload maps, the cart will not move backwards after any duration of time and there is no time limit; the map will only 
				end when one team successfully pushes their cart to the finish point. Parts of the track may feature slopes or other obstacles 
				on which the cart will quickly roll back down to the bottom unless being constantly pushed. Sections of the track that can do 
				this will have chevrons on the progress bar to help show how far the cart must be pushed to overcome them.
			</p>
			<p>
				Payload Race maps are either single- or multi-stage. Pipeline and Nightfall are split into three stages, whereas Hightower 
				consists of only one stage. Winning in each of the first two stages will give an advantage to the winning team in the next 
				stage (the cart is pushed slightly forward from the starting point).
