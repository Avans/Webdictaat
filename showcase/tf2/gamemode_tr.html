			<h1>Training</h1>
			<hr>
			<p>
				Training Mode is a single-player only game mode that helps players learn the basics of the different classes available 
				in the game. The mode is aimed towards inexperienced players and demonstrates gameplay mechanics and teamwork within a 
				"safe" environment. A series of specific scenarios are given for each class.
			</p>
			<p>
				Target training is composed of four sections, Soldier, Demoman, Spy, and Engineer training, in that order. In Soldier 
				training, the player begins in a simple spawn room and is instructed basic movement commands, including W S A D
				directional movement, crouching, and jumping, to reach a small booth supplied with health and ammo. In the booth, the player
				is taught how to use the Rocket Launcher, Shotgun, and Shovel at the weapon's optimal ranges upon wooden targets. Upon destroying 
				these targets, a special 'HIT!' particle will appear if it was destroyed correctly; otherwise, the target is indestructible. After
				practicing upon wooden targets, the player is given live targets that will move around, attempting to fool the player. There are 
				no weapon restrictions in this portion, so it is up to the player how they destroy the targets. After completing Soldier target 
				training, the game proceeds to Dustbowl training.
			</p>
			<p>
				In Demoman training, the player spawns in said booth, and is unable to move from that booth. Similarly to Soldier training, the 
				player is first given wooden targets and required to use the appropriate weapon to destroy it. The player is given targets in 
				special situations designed for Demomen; for example, the player is given a target partially hidden behind an object to be 
				destroyed with the Grenade Launcher, five targets which must be destroyed by a single stickybomb detonation, and a target far 
				away for destruction by a charged Stickybomb. Unlike Soldier training, there are no live targets. After completing Demoman 
				training, Spy training is unlocked.
			</p>
			<p>
				In Spy training, a friendly Spy bot demonstrates cloaking to move past a Sentry Gun. The barriers of the booth are then lowered, 
				and the player is allowed to do the same. The player will then be educated on disguises and sapping, and will have the chance to
				employ these techniques against a hostile Sentry Gun. Live targets are then provided for training the backstab ability, as well 
				as demonstrating that a person with your name is an enemy Spy. After completing Spy training, Engineer training is unlocked.
			</p>
			<p>
				In Engineer training, the player is first taught how to use the Build PDA to build a Dispenser, and how metal is consumed in 
				doing so. It also teaches that hitting the building with the Wrench will speed up construction, and the purpose of the Dispenser.
				Next, the player is taught how to upgrade buildings, and the player is required to upgrade the Dispenser to level 3. After this,
				the barriers will lower, and the player is required to build a Sentry Gun at the indicated position, and upgrade it to level 3. 
				The player is taught that metal can also be obtained from ammo boxes and dropped weapons. Afterwards, the player is told to use 
				the Sentry Gun as cover as the Red team attacks. The Red team will damage the buildings, and the player is taught that the Wrench 
				can repair them. The player is instructed to haul the Dispenser next to the Sentry Gun, and informs the player that a Dispenser 
				nearby can provide health and metal during an attack. Afterwards, the player is told to build a Teleporter entrance and exit. 
				It instructs that repairing one end repairs the other, and that on the Teleporter exit, there is an arrow which indicates the 
				exit direction for players. Finally, it instructs the use of the Destroy PDA. 
				When the player destroys all of the buildings, Engineer training ends.
