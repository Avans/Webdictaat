			<h1>Engineer</h1>
			<hr>
			<p>
				The Engineer is a soft-spoken, amiable Texan with an interest in all things mechanical. He specializes in constructing and maintaining 
				Buildings that provide support to his team, rather than fighting at the front lines. The Engineer's various gadgets include the Sentry Gun, 
				an automated turret that fires at any enemy in range, the Dispenser, a device that restores the health and ammunition of nearby teammates, and 
				Teleporters that quickly transport players from point A to point B.
			</p>

			<p>
				Because the Engineer's ingenious devices are under constant threat from explosives and devious enemy Spies, a good Engineer must keep his gear 
				under a watchful eye and under repair with his Wrench at all times. When the Engineer needs to get his hands dirty, his trio of generic yet 
				capable weapons, along with the assistance of his helpful hardware, make him more than capable of holding his own in a fight. If need be, the 
				Engineer can even pick up and haul constructed buildings to redeploy them in more favorable locations (unless using the Eureka Effect).
			</p>
			
			<h2>Gameplay</h2>
			<hr>
			<p>
			The Engineer has the unique ability to construct Buildings. Although he possesses a weaker set of weapons, his Sentry Gun is more than enough 
			to fend off multiple enemies. His Teleporter system sends teammates to the front lines, while his Dispenser heals and supplies ammunition. 
			After constructing a building, he can pick up and haul it to a new location, allowing him to keep his base alongside an offensive push. The 
			Engineer and his buildings will frequently be targeted by Demomen and Spies. A well-timed enemy ÃœberCharge, in particular, can quickly ruin all 
			of his hard work. When his buildings are destroyed, it is most important that the Engineer makes it out alive so that he can reconstruct his base. 
			A good Engineer will place his buildings in strategic locations and not be afraid to get his hands dirty defending them.
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Use the build tool to construct Sentry Guns, Dispensers, and Teleporters in places that are beneficial to your team.</li>
				<li>You need metal to build, repair, and upgrade your Buildings. Collect fallen weapons or remains of buildings to get more metal.</li>
				<li>Hit your Sentry Gun with your Wrench to upgrade it with metal. Each level adds more health and firepower.</li>
				<li>Build Dispensers to provide your teammates with health and ammo. They also generate metal for you to use.</li>
				<li>Build Teleporters to help your team get to key locations with ease.</li>
				<li>Keep an eye out for enemy Spies attaching Sappers to your Buildings. Use your Wrench to remove Sappers.</li>
