			<h1>Capture the Flag</h1>
			<hr>
			<p>
				Capture the Flag (CTF) is a game mode which features both RED and BLU teams with their own Intelligence briefcase 
				(known as the flag). The goal for both teams is to capture their enemy's Intelligence continuously until they have
				reached the game's capture limit (default limit is 3) whilst preventing their enemy from achieving the same. If no 
				team completes the capture limit before time runs out, the match will enter Sudden Death mode (unless either 
				Intelligence has been taken and is still in play, in which case Overtime occurs until both teams' Intelligence 
				are secured again).
			</p>
			
			<h2>Gameplay</h2>
			<hr>
			<p>
			During a Capture the Flag round, each team is given their own Intelligence located within their section of the map. 
			It must be retrieved from this location by the opposite team and returned to a defined point, usually the opposing 
			team's capture zone where their Intelligence is stored.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			The Intelligence can be taken by any enemy player that walks up onto it. It will then appear on their back and the 
			Announcer will notify both teams that the Intelligence has been taken. The Intelligence indicator located on the HUD
			will then point in the direction of the carrier who must make their way out of the enemy base and back to their own. 
			Carriers are visible to their respective team players as they emit a green, yellow or red glow (based on their current 
			health) that can be seen through walls.
			</p>

			<p>
			While carrying the Intelligence, players become more vulnerable. For example, a player cannot use Teleporters. 
			The Medic's ÜberCharge cannot be used on the Intelligence carrier nor can a player pick up the Intelligence while 
			under its effects. Scouts are also unable to drink Bonk! Atomic Punch while holding the Intelligence, and may not
			pick it up while under its effects. Spies are unable to pick up the Intelligence while Cloaked, but can pick it up
			while in disguise although this is automatically removed. Furthermore, the Spy cannot disguise or Cloak while 
			carrying the Intelligence, and will automatically drop it if they do. Finally, the Intelligence is dropped 
			automatically if the carrier is killed or enters a resupply area.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			Once the Intelligence is returned to a capture point, the successful team will gain one point shown in the 
			Intelligence indicator, and will receive ten seconds of crit boost. There is no need for the capturing team's 
			own Intelligence to be on their capture point at the time of the capture.
