			The sky is the limit only for those who aren't afraid to fly!

			Where ignorance lurks, so too do the frontiers of discovery and imagination.

			To be the first to enter the cosmos, to engage, single-handed, in an unprecedented duel with nature—could one dream of anything more?

			The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow.

			A Chinese tale tells of some men sent to harm a young girl who, upon seeing her beauty, become her protectors rather than her violators. That's how I felt seeing the Earth for the first time. I could not help but love and cherish her.

			That's one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind. <br>

			I believe every human has a finite number of heartbeats. I don't intend to waste any of mine

			Dinosaurs are extinct today because they lacked opposable thumbs and the brainpower to build a space program.

			Astronomy compels the soul to look upward, and leads us from this world to another.

			The regret on our side is, they used to say years ago, we are reading about you in science class. Now they say, we are reading about you in history class.

			Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next 10. <br>

			As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.

			We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to win.

			Where ignorance lurks, so too do the frontiers of discovery and imagination.

		The path of a cosmonaut is not an easy, triumphant march to glory. You have to get to know the meaning not just of joy but also of grief, before being allowed in the spacecraft cabin.

		Never in all their history have men been able truly to conceive of the world as one: a single sphere, a globe, having the qualities of a globe, a round earth in which all the directions eventually meet, in which there is no center because every point, or none, is center — an equal earth which all men occupy as equals. The airman's earth, if free men make it, will be truly round: a globe in practice, not in theory.

		When I orbited the Earth in a spaceship, I saw for the first time how beautiful our planet is. Mankind, let us preserve and increase this beauty, and not destroy it!

		I believe every human has a finite number of heartbeats. I don't intend to waste any of mine

		Curious that we spend more time congratulating people who have succeeded than encouraging people who have not.

		NASA is not about the ‘Adventure of Human Space Exploration’…We won’t be doing it just to get out there in space – we’ll be doing it because the things we learn out there will be making life better for a lot of people who won’t be able to go.

		Here men from the planet Earth first set foot upon the Moon. July 1969 AD. We came in peace for all mankind.

		For those who have seen the Earth from space, and for the hundreds and perhaps thousands more who will, the experience most certainly changes your perspective. The things that we share in our world are far more valuable than those which divide us.

		Across the sea of space, the stars are other suns.

		Problems look mighty small from 150 miles up.<br>

		There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.

		The sky is the limit only for those who aren't afraid to fly!

		Failure is not an option.<br>

		The regret on our side is, they used to say years ago, we are reading about you in science class. Now they say, we are reading about you in history class.
