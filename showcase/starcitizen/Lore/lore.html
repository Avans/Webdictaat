			We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to win.

			Here men from the planet Earth first set foot upon the Moon. July 1969 AD. We came in peace for all mankind.

			What was most significant about the lunar voyage was not that man set foot on the Moon but that they set eye on the earth.

			<li>1923 - The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow.</li>
			<li>2001 - Many say exploration is part of our destiny, but it’s actually our duty to future generations and their quest to ensure the survival of the human species.</li>
			<li>2002 -Many say exploration is part of our destiny, but it’s actually our duty to future generations and their quest to ensure the survival of the human species.</li>
			<li>2101 - When I orbited the Earth in a spaceship, I saw for the first time how beautiful our planet is. Mankind, let us preserve and increase this beauty, and not destroy it!</li>
			<li>2216 - It suddenly struck me that that tiny pea, pretty and blue, was the Earth. I put up my thumb and shut one eye, and my thumb blotted out the planet Earth. I didn't feel like a giant. I felt very, very small.</li>
			<li>2145 - To be the first to enter the cosmos, to engage, single-handed, in an unprecedented duel with nature—could one dream of anything more?</li>
			<li>2176 - We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to win.</li>
			<li>2199 - Astronomy compels the soul to look upward, and leads us from this world to another.</li>
			<li>2201 - Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.</li>
			<li>2167 - We have an infinite amount to learn both from nature and from each other</li>
			<li>2171 - Failure is not an option.</li>
			<li>2177 - Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</li>
			<li>2188 - Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</li>
			<li>2195 - A Chinese tale tells of some men sent to harm a young girl who, upon seeing her beauty, become her protectors rather than her violators. That's how I felt seeing the Earth for the first time. I could not help but love and cherish her.</li>
			<li>2212 - The regret on our side is, they used to say years ago, we are reading about you in science class. Now they say, we are reading about you in history class.</li>
			<li>2215 - I believe every human has a finite number of heartbeats. I don't intend to waste any of mine</li>
			<li>2265 - Buy why, some say, the moon? Why choose this as our goal? And they may as well ask why climb the highest mountain?</li>
