			NASA is not about the ‘Adventure of Human Space Exploration’…We won’t be doing it just to get out there in space – we’ll be doing it because the things we learn out there will be making life better for a lot of people who won’t be able to go.

			When I orbited the Earth in a spaceship, I saw for the first time how beautiful our planet is. Mankind, let us preserve and increase this beauty, and not destroy it!

			Houston, Tranquillity Base here. The Eagle has landed.

			The path of a cosmonaut is not an easy, triumphant march to glory. You have to get to know the meaning not just of joy but also of grief, before being allowed in the spacecraft cabin.

			As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.

			Buy why, some say, the moon? Why choose this as our goal? And they may as well ask why climb the highest mountain? <br>

			Dinosaurs are extinct today because they lacked opposable thumbs and the brainpower to build a space program.

			We have an infinite amount to learn both from nature and from each other

			We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to win.

			When I orbited the Earth in a spaceship, I saw for the first time how beautiful our planet is. Mankind, let us preserve and increase this beauty, and not destroy it!!

			I don't know what you could say about a day in which you have seen four beautiful sunsets.

			Across the sea of space, the stars are other suns.

			You know, being a test pilot isn't always the healthiest business in the world.

			When I orbited the Earth in a spaceship, I saw for the first time how beautiful our planet is. Mankind, let us preserve and increase this beauty, and not destroy it!

			Failure is not an option.

			If you could see the earth illuminated when you were in a place as dark as night, it would look to you more splendid than the moon.<br>	

			The Earth was small, light blue, and so touchingly alone, our home that must be defended like a holy relic. The Earth was absolutely round. I believe I never knew what the word round meant until I saw Earth from space.

			As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore . . . and this is exploration at its greatest.

			Science cuts two way of course; its products can be used for both good and evil. But there's no turning back from science. The early warnings about technological dangers also come from science.

			The Earth was small, light blue, and so touchingly alone, our home that must be defended like a holy relic. The Earth was absolutely round. I believe I never knew what the word round meant until I saw Earth from space.

			Never in all their history have men been able truly to conceive of the world as one: a single sphere, a globe, having the qualities of a globe, a round earth in which all the directions eventually meet, in which there is no center because every point, or none, is center — an equal earth which all men occupy as equals. The airman's earth, if free men make it, will be truly round: a globe in practice, not in theory.

			Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next 10.<br>

			It suddenly struck me that that tiny pea, pretty and blue, was the Earth. I put up my thumb and shut one eye, and my thumb blotted out the planet Earth. I didn't feel like a giant. I felt very, very small.

			You know, being a test pilot isn't always the healthiest business in the world.

			Curious that we spend more time congratulating people who have succeeded than encouraging people who have not.

			Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.

			Here men from the planet Earth first set foot upon the Moon. July 1969 AD. We came in peace for all mankind.<br>

			The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow.

			If you could see the earth illuminated when you were in a place as dark as night, it would look to you more splendid than the moon.

			That's one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind.

			The sky is the limit only for those who aren't afraid to fly!
