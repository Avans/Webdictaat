			Curious that we spend more time congratulating people who have succeeded than encouraging people who have not.

			Astronomy compels the soul to look upward, and leads us from this world to another.

			Across the sea of space, the stars are other suns. <br>

			I believe every human has a finite number of heartbeats. I don't intend to waste any of mine

			To be the first to enter the cosmos, to engage, single-handed, in an unprecedented duel with nature—could one dream of anything more?

			As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore . . . and this is exploration at its greatest.

			If you could see the earth illuminated when you were in a place as dark as night, it would look to you more splendid than the moon.

			Problems look mighty small from 150 miles up.

			I don't know what you could say about a day in which you have seen four beautiful sunsets.<br>

			There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.

			Dinosaurs are extinct today because they lacked opposable thumbs and the brainpower to build a space program.

			NASA is not about the ‘Adventure of Human Space Exploration’…We won’t be doing it just to get out there in space – we’ll be doing it because the things we learn out there will be making life better for a lot of people who won’t be able to go.

			Here men from the planet Earth first set foot upon the Moon. July 1969 AD. We came in peace for all mankind.

			The sky is the limit only for those who aren't afraid to fly!<br>

			Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.

			A Chinese tale tells of some men sent to harm a young girl who, upon seeing her beauty, become her protectors rather than her violators. That's how I felt seeing the Earth for the first time. I could not help but love and cherish her.

			As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore . . . and this is exploration at its greatest.

			Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.

			The sky is the limit only for those who aren't afraid to fly!

			That's one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind.

			You know, being a test pilot isn't always the healthiest business in the world.<br>

			We want to explore. We’re curious people. Look back over history, people have put their lives at stake to go out and explore … We believe in what we’re doing. Now it’s time to go.

			Failure is not an option.

			To go places and do things that have never been done before – that’s what living is all about.

			Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next 10.

			Many say exploration is part of our destiny, but it’s actually our duty to future generations and their quest to ensure the survival of the human species.

			Where ignorance lurks, so too do the frontiers of discovery and imagination.

			The path of a cosmonaut is not an easy, triumphant march to glory. You have to get to know the meaning not just of joy but also of grief, before being allowed in the spacecraft cabin.

			We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to win.

			For those who have seen the Earth from space, and for the hundreds and perhaps thousands more who will, the experience most certainly changes your perspective. The things that we share in our world are far more valuable than those which divide us.

			If you could see the earth illuminated when you were in a place as dark as night, it would look to you more splendid than the moon.<br>

			As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.
