            <img class="photo floatright news3foto" src="images/news/richards.jpg" alt="Keith Richard">
            <p>The death of a child is by far one of the most traumatic things one can experience in life.</p>
            <p>When Keith Richards lost his 10-week-old son, Tara back in 1976, it understandably brought him to a dark place.</p>
            <p>Tara was a victim of sudden infant death syndrome, more commonly known as SIDS or "cot death."</p>
            <p>When Richards learned of his son's passing, he was on the road with The Rolling Stones about to play a show.</p>
            <p>It's that concert in France, that Richards credits with saving his own life.</p>
            <p>"It was such a shock at the time, especially getting a phone call in Paris and this happened in Geneva, and I thought, I'm going to go mad unless I do this show tonight," Richards tells BBC Radio's Desert Island Discs.</p>
            <p>"Maybe it was a sense of self-preservation. It was a rough, rough thing. And I had a feeling, I must go on stage now and I'll worry and grieve and think about all this after the show. Because if didn't go on the stage I'd have probably shot myself."</p>
            <p>Listen to Keith Richards' full interview with Desert Island Discs on their <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b06kb0fw">website</a>.</p>
